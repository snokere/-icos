BitCar ICO 
https://bitcar.io/ \
BitCar provides a platform that allows anyone with cryptocurrencies to purchase an interest or P2P fractionally trade in exotic care. 
Rare collectable Exotic Cars are limited to the very wealthy and hard to access. Historically these cars make up one of the best performing asset classes over the last decade. BitCar is the first platform in the world that will allow you to P2P trade fractions of exotic cars using your crypto. Owners can peg their crypto to these hard assets for protection during times of high crypto volatility. Users will have access to this historically outperforming asset class for the first time through BitCar. BitCar will then also seek to provide fractional ownership services to the very large automotive industry using this new decentralized blockchain technology.
The tokens are ERC20 tokens built on the Ethereum blockchain. They can be used for a number of purposes within the BitCar ecosystem, including voting, transaction fees, car token payments, escrow, and usage of the BitCar vehicles.
The BitCar ecosystem has two tokens. BITCAR are primary level tokens, while CAR are exotic asset tokens. CAR tokens are also ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While BITCAR tokens are designed to perform roles in the BitCar ecosystem, CAR tokens represent real, legal ownership of a luxury vehicle.
